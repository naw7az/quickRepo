1. AI/Machine Learning/Data Science
   Deep Learning < ML < AI overlaps with Data Science
   Stanford University describes machine learning as the science of getting computers to act
   without being explicitly programmed that is getting machines to do things without us          specifically saying something.
   
2. Types of ML problems
   a. Supervised Learning - I know my inputs and outputs.
   b. Unsupervised Learning - I'm not sure of the outputs but i have inputs.
   c. Transfer Learning - I think my problem is similar to other problem.
   d. Reinforcement Learning - I need to award when right and punish when wrong.
   
3. Why Numpy
   Reasons for using Numpy(Numerical Python):
   1. Numpy is written in C, so it's much faster than python list(array).
   2. Machines understand in 1s and 0s, and it's easy for numby to convert different datas
      (like images, strings, bool) into numbers and do the operation in it.
   3. It's Backbone of other DS packages(like pandas).
   
4. Scikit-Learn is a (vast) python library used to create ML models.
   Why sk learn ?
   1. Built on NumPy and Matplotlib(and python)
   2. Has many in-built machine learning models
   3. Methods to evaluate your machine learning models
   4. Very well-designed API
   
5. Refreshing: What is Machine Learning ?
   For a normal Computer Program, we give the input and function and recieve the output.
   But for a Machine Learning Program, we give input and output and recive a 
   proper function(model) to get the output from the input.
